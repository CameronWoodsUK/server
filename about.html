        <h2>About my site</h2>
        <p>This is a website I've made in my free time.<br>It has a couple of silly little features you play around with.</p>

        <h2>The cute animals page</h2>
        <p>The random animals are chosen using some tools I found online that return random photos of the animals in question.<br>
        The top animal is found by taking today's top trending photo from their respective subreddits.</p>

        <h2>The calculator</h2>
        <p>All the sums you put into the calculator are sent to my assisstant who works them out by hand so please be patient if he takes a minute<br>
        He says some weird things sometimes though, so just ignore his ramblings and definitely don't try to send him any messages via the calculator input</p>

        <h2>How things work</h2>
        <p>The server hosting this site and all the features and decoration of the site were written entirely by me more or less from scratch, so if something doesn't work properly that's probably why.<br>
        Every request your browser sends is dealt with using code I wrote myself that's running on an old raspberry pi, so some things may take a minute to load, please <a href="media/bear.gif">bear</a> with.<br>
        If you're interested you can see the source code <a href="source.html">here!</a></p>
        <h3>Proxy server</h3>
        <p>The code viewer thing was such a massive pain to get to get working and I ended up having to make my own proxy server<br>
        If you want to try it out for whatever reason then just append a full link including the http(s) bit after "cameronwoods.lol/proxy/[YOUR LINK HERE]"</p>

	<h4>PS</h4>
	<p>The code viewer and proxy server dont work right now and won't work until I get around to fixing them</p>
