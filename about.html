        <h2>About my site</h2>
        <p>This is a website I've made in my free time.<br>It has a couple of silly little features for you to play around with.</p>

        <h3>The cute animals page</h3>
        <p>The random animals are chosen using some tools I found online that return random photos of the animals in question.<br>
        The top animal is found by taking today's top trending photo from their respective subreddits.</p>

        <h3>The calculator</h3>
        <p>All the calculations you put into the calculator are sent to my assisstant who works them out by hand so please be patient if he takes a minute.<br>
        He says some weird things sometimes though, so just ignore his ramblings and definitely don't try to send him any messages via the calculator input.</p>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>The chess engine was written by me so sometimes it maybe does weird pawn moves, if something crazy does happen; please let me know so I can fix it.<br>
        The bot just picks a random legal move so not the best to play against at the moment, but I will be improving it soon</p>

        <h3>How things work</h3>
        <p>The server hosting this site and all the features and decoration were written entirely by me more or less from scratch, so if something doesn't work properly that's probably why.<br>
        Every request your browser sends is dealt with using code I wrote myself that's running on an old raspberry pi, so some things may take a minute to load, please <a href="media/bear.gif">bear</a> with.<br>
        If you're interested, you can see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/CameronWoodsUK/server" target="_blank">my github</a></p>
